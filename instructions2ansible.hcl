Creating an automation task to continuously set up cloud accounts and automatically deploy Kali Linux with tools involves multiple steps and technologies. Hereâ€™s a high-level overview and a script example using Terraform for cloud provisioning (e.g., AWS) and Ansible for configuration management.

Prerequisites:
1.Terraform: To automate cloud resource creation.

2.Ansible: To automate software installation and configuration.

3.AWS CLI: For interacting with AWS.

4.IAM credentials**: With necessary permissions to create resources.

Steps:
1.Set up AWS account creation (if applicable): Typically, this isn't automated due to security and compliance reasons. Manual steps or organizational accounts are recommended.
2.Use Terraform to create an EC2 instance: Configure Terraform to deploy Kali Linux.
3.Use Ansible to configure the Kali Linux instance: Install necessary tools and configure the environment.

Example Terraform Script:

`main.tf`:

hcl:
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

resource "aws_instance" "kali" {
  ami           = "ami-12345678" # Replace with the Kali Linux AMI ID
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  key_name = "my-key-pair" # Replace with your key pair

  tags = {
    Name = "KaliLinuxInstance"
  }

  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "ansible-playbook -i ${self.public_ip}, -u ec2-user --private-key /path/to/my-key-pair.pem setup_kali.yml"
  }

  connection {
    type        = "ssh"
    user        = "ec2-user"
    private_key = file("/path/to/my-key-pair.pem")
    host        = self.public_ip
  }

  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    inline = [
      "sudo apt-get update",
      "sudo apt-get install -y ansible",
    ]
  }
}

Example Ansible Playbook:
`setup_kali.yml`:

.yaml
---
- name: Configure Kali Linux
  hosts: all
  become: yes

  tasks:
    - name: Update and upgrade apt packages
      apt:
        update_cache: yes
        upgrade: dist

    - name: Install common tools
      apt:
        name:
          - nmap
          - wireshark
          - metasploit-framework
          - john
          - aircrack-ng
        state: present

Steps to Execute:

1.Install Terraform and Ansible:

Install Terraform (https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)

Install Ansible (https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html)

Install AWS CLI: 
`pip install awscli`

2.Configure AWS CLI: 
Set up your AWS credentials.

!#bash
aws configure

3.Initialize and apply Terraform:

!#bash
terraform init
terraform apply

Explanation:
Terraform creates an AWS EC2 instance using the specified Kali Linux AMI.
Provisioner: 
Ansible is used to configure the instance after creation. `local-exec` runs the Ansible playbook from your local machine, and `remote-exec` is used to install Ansible on the instance if needed.
Ansible Playbook: 
The playbook installs and configures the necessary tools on the Kali Linux instance.
